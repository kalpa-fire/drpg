# DRPG Test

This is my response to the DRPG coding challenge. I have ignored pagination to implement the search functionality as discussed over email with Paul. 

To run the app, install the dependencies with `npm install` and run the `npm run dev` command. The app will run on port 3000. `npm run test` will run the tests.

I worked a little over 4 hours on the project. If given more time, I would continue to extend testing coverage (I've set up MSW to test the api requests) and impleent a few style improvements (there's no responsiveness in place and the table styles don't look particularly good).
